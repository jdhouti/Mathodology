# Mathodology

Mathodology is a library of algorithms written to manipulate
+ lists
+ boolean expressions
+ numbers
+ strings
+ vectors

Algorithms were written and developed to manipulate lists and all of the above types in the most efficient and elegant way possible. In the event that a faster algorithm is found, it will replace the older algorithm which will be written in the `OLD-ALGORITHMS.md` file.
